I used RGB LED strips to make a dynamic backlighting system for my roommate's computer monitor. A background process runs on the computer and evaluates the average color in each grid square around the border of the screen in realtime, and adjusts the colors of the corresponding LEDs to match. This creates a cool effect when watching movies or playing games.
