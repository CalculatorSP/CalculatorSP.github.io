# [Gameboy Costume](gameboy-costume.md)

I turned myself into a Gameboy using a foam board, a 10" HDMI display, a Raspberry Pi (running RetroPie), and some custom touch-sensitive gloves. The gloves work using Teensy's capacitive touch sensing capabilities - the first version (shown in the video) used pieces of metal as the touch pads, but I later replaced them with conductive thread for a more sleek look (will add pictures later).
