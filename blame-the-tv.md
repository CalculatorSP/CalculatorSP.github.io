In many fast-paced video games, the difference between winning and losing can be a matter of milliseconds between the press of a button and the action of the character. One of my roommates, a huge Super Smash Bros. fan, wanted to precisely measure this delay using a high-speed camera. He wired an LED to a button on his Gamecube controller, and used the camera to record the state of the LED and the on-screen character. Processing and analyzing this high-framerate data proved tedious, so I helped him develop some tools (in C++ with OpenCV) to streamline the process.
